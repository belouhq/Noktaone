    "contactUs": "Contact us",
    "whatIsNokta": {
      "question": "What is Nokta One, exactly?",
      "answer": "Nokta One is a body and nervous system reset technology. In seconds, it identifies when your body is \"off\" and suggests a simple micro-action to return to a functional, clear, and high-performing state.\n\nIt's not meditation, therapy, or medical monitoring.\nIt's an immediate adjustment tool, usable in real-life situations."
    },
    "whenUseful": {
      "question": "When is Nokta One useful?",
      "answer": "Nokta One is designed for moments when you think:\n\n• \"I don't feel well, but I don't know why\"\n• \"I'm tense for no clear reason\"\n• \"I can't concentrate\"\n• \"My body is tired, but my mind wants to keep going\"\n• \"I'm not at my best\"\n\nThese moments happen before important meetings, after mental overload, between demanding tasks, before sports or competitions, at the end of the day when your body gives out, or in the morning when energy is low.\n\nNokta One is designed for these daily micro-imbalances, not for medical situations."
    },
    "whyOffButOk": {
      "question": "Why do I sometimes feel \"fine\" but not function properly?",
      "answer": "Because your body and nervous system can be out of sync.\n\nYou might:\n• Have a good heart rate but feel overwhelmed\n• Be mentally calm but physically restless\n• Be motivated but unable to start\n\nNOKTA ONE is based on the principle that bodily sensation comes before mental performance."
    },
    "differentFromOthers": {
      "question": "How is NOKTA ONE different from traditional wellness apps?",
      "answer": "Most apps ask you to:\n• Understand how you feel\n• Choose a practice\n• Commit for a long time\n\nNOKTA ONE does the opposite:\n• It starts from the bodily signal, not your analysis\n• It reduces the choice to a single action\n• It acts in under 30 seconds\n\nLess thinking, less friction, more impact."
    },
    "analyzeEmotions": {
      "question": "Does NOKTA ONE \"analyze\" my emotions?",
      "answer": "NOKTA ONE doesn't judge you or make any assessments.\n\nIt only observes neutral bodily indicators (posture, tension, visible micro-signals) to estimate an overall functional state.\n\nThe goal is not to tell you \"how you feel,\" but to detect when your body isn't aligned with what you want to do."
    },
    "replaceProfessional": {
      "question": "Does NOKTA ONE replace a healthcare professional?",
      "answer": "No.\n\nNOKTA ONE is a daily regulation tool, not a medical device. It doesn't address any conditions, make any therapeutic promises, and never replaces medical advice.\n\nIt's designed for functional, active, demanding people who want to stay at their best without waiting to feel unwell."
    },
    "whyBodyNotMind": {
      "question": "Why act on the body rather than the mind?",
      "answer": "Because in most cases:\n• The mind follows the body\n• Clarity comes after regulation\n• Performance returns when the nervous system is stable\n\nA well-targeted micro-action can produce an immediate effect, where a mental approach takes more time."
    },
    "howOften": {
      "question": "How often should I use NOKTA ONE?",
      "answer": "NOKTA ONE doesn't impose any rhythm.\n\nSome use it:\n• 1-2 times a day for a quick check\n• Before a key moment\n• Only when \"something feels off\"\n\nThe goal is not dependency, but autonomy."
    },
    "forAthletesOnly": {
      "question": "Is NOKTA ONE just for athletes or entrepreneurs?",
      "answer": "No, but it's particularly useful for those seeking:\n• Clarity\n• Consistency\n• Sustainable performance\n\nThe launch targets the US market, which is very performance-oriented, but NOKTA ONE is designed for all cultures, ages, and lifestyles."
    },
    "dontBelieveBreathing": {
      "question": "Does it work even if I don't believe in \"breathing techniques\"?",
      "answer": "Yes, because NOKTA ONE doesn't rely on belief.\n\nThe proposed micro-actions are:\n• Simple\n• Short\n• Based on known physiological mechanisms\n\nYou don't need to \"believe\" anything.\nYou do the action, you observe the effect."
    },
    "whySoShort": {
