You are working on NOKTA ONE. Non-negotiable rule: do NOT hardcode user-facing strings.

Goal: every UI string must be a translation key resolved via i18n.
Source of truth: lib/i18n/locales/en.json (English).
All other locales are generated automatically by npm run i18n:sync.

Strict rules:
1) NEVER overwrite or restructure existing files unless necessary. Make minimal diffs.
2) Any new UI text must be added to lib/i18n/locales/en.json with a stable dotted key (e.g., "scan.completed").
3) Replace inline strings with t("...") calls.
4) Keep brand tokens unchanged: "Nokta One", "NOKTA ONE", "Skane", "SKANE", "Skane Index", "Reset".
5) Use microcopy style: 2–6 words, simple, body-focused, no jargon, no explanations.
6) Never use medical/mental-health words in new English strings: diagnosis, treatment, medical, disease, disorder, stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, therapy, meditation.
7) Preserve placeholders exactly ({name}, {count}, %d, etc).
8) Ensure RTL-safe layout for Arabic/Hebrew if present (use dir="rtl" based on locale).

After implementing:
- run npm run i18n:sync
- ensure lib/i18n/locales/*.json updated and committed (or in PR diff)
- if i18n-sync report indicates fallback used, do not change logic; it will self-heal when API is available.
